# Discord Oxygen

Discord Oxygen is a project I (hxr404) started as a kid, now I'm done with it.<br />
Consider this a final goodbye, I'm deleting my account.

Kept this org around as a public archive so people interested in my former work can use it and understand what the fuck happened.
(GitHub would just delete my repos together with my account)

Was nice meetin y'all, take care
